# Seasonal Air Quality Control Using Control Charts - February 2021
This project focuses on analyzing air quality data from station 027DL in India over the years 2019 and 2020. The dataset includes the Air Quality Index (AQI) and individual pollutant levels, with no missing values. The data analysis aimed to compare pollution levels across seasons, particularly between spring (representing lower pollution levels) and winter (representing higher pollution levels). The weekly averages were calculated, and control charts (X-bar and R charts) were generated to monitor pollution trends. The 2019 data was used to establish initial control limits for pollutants, and 2020 data was utilized for validation and further analysis. Tools like Excel and Minitab were used for data visualization and calculation.

In the first phase, upper and lower control limits (UCL and LCL) were determined based on the 2019 data, and outliers were identified for both seasons. Weekly observations exceeding the control limits were analyzed, revealing that certain pollutants, like PM 2.5 and NOx, were key contributors to poor air quality during specific weeks. The second phase involved applying the refined control limits to the 2020 data, with a focus on understanding the causes of pollution spikes. The results showed cleaner air in spring 2020 but elevated pollutant levels during certain weeks in winter, prompting further investigation into the sources of specific pollutants.
